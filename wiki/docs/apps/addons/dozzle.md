# Dozzle - [dozzle.dev](https://dozzle.dev/)

Dozzle is a small lightweight application with a web based interface to monitor Docker logs. It doesn‚Äôt store any log files. It is for live monitoring of your container logs only.

## Features

- Intelligent fuzzy search for container names ü§ñ
- Search logs using regex üî¶
- Small memory footprint üèé
- Split screen for viewing multiple logs
- Download logs easy
- Live stats with memory and CPU usage
- Authentication with username and password üö®

Dozzle should work for most. It has been tested with hundreds of containers. However, it doesn't support offline searching. Products like [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com), [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com) or [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) are more suited for full search capabilities.

Dozzle doesn't cost any money and aims to focus on real-time debugging.
